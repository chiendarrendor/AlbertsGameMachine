meteor code not complete

ship is too small
telegate is too small
next space marker doesnt animate
planets not finished
orbit marker is ugly
asteroids are ugly
control panels/player panel/base panel/dice panel need prettying


no display for partial-privacy of races and qboxes

lockandpop icons need to be more obvious
drag point of lockandpop should be obvious
inset popandlock icons/windows a pixel or two
arrow keys for scrolling
"no money" -> "too pricy"
put in '1x'
get rid of 'X' for errors
"not buyer" -> "can't sell here"
"is new" -> "can't jettison yet"

need more visible and consistent representation of acting player
	(grey/red border for trade window if it is not player)

redo player panel
add spaces in race name/location
implement race tokens for culture boxes
put player funds into penalty control panel
remove qbox box after space is emptied
auto-scroll to acting player
hover over planet causes race window to pop up
commission blue is too dark
tool tip help for relics
documentation page
'stop and pick up or fly on' control for entering a relic space 
full trade panel too big for mac 1440x900 (diff font on Mac?)

Select Player Color (part of InitialPanel maybe?)
sort Qossuth at 10

?jettison/dropoff for no money should require verification
