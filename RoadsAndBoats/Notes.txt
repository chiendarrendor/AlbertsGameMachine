Setting up:
	* which spaces are starting spaces?
	* put transporters on space
	* put goods on space
	* must be at least one empty tile between player starting spaces
	* set player starting space
Production:
	* which spaces have primary producers?
	* mines: variable output (known output for 1-player)
	* load goods on transporters
	* unload goods from transporters
	* delete goods from space (operating factories)
	* which neighboring spaces are 'local' (on same tile)
	* remove transporter (building wagons, obsolescence)
	* contents of tile (for breeding)
