Comment:
This is a scenario with lots of land and great opportunities
to use all different kinds of transportation.  Start at the 
marked spaces on the indicated side of the river.
There are more than enough resources in this game, so the
only trouble will probably be about the mines.

A relatively fast game that is suitable for beginners and may
be a bit too easy for those who are more experienced.
