# AlbertsGameMachine
This is the result of my vision to create a programming language designed to specify the rules of board games, and an impementation thereof, comprising a C++ server, a Perl compiler that takes the C++ imbedded in XML and compiles a DLL for the server, and a Java browser applet that uses an XML file to specify the GUI for each game.    While this all works, the result is a bit of a mess and basically needs a full rewrite.  The only game currently 100% functional is Outpost, but that requires a complete UX redesign.   The build process is also really wonky and manual.

The recent updates to this allow it to be built in an AWS EC2 instance, and installed, on AWS CloudFront.   One of the files installed on CloudFront is a Java JAR that can be run as a standalone App (since Java is long since persona non grata on Web Browsers)
One of the systemic changes made for this update was that all client-side resources (text files, images, etc) are now stored in the JAR and the client side generic libraries updated to reflect this change.
This change has only so far been propagated through the Outpost client code, other clients will fail to load resources (but since Outpost is the only completed game in the System, that's not awful)
