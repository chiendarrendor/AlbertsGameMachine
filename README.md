# AlbertsGameMachine
This is the result of my vision to create a programming language designed to specify the rules of board games, and an impementation thereof, comprising a C++ server, a Perl compiler that takes the C++ imbedded in XML and compiles a DLL for the server, and a Java browser applet that uses an XML file to specify the GUI for each game.    While this all works, the result is a bit of a mess and basically needs a full rewrite.  The only game currently 100% functional is Outpost, but that requires a complete UX redesign.   The build process is also really wonky and manual.
